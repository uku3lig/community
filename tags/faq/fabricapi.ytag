    title: Fabric API

---

In most Fabric modding setups, you have to install Fabric (API), which you can download here: https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api. Make sure to install the _latest version of Fabric (API) for the version of Minecraft you are using_. Fabric (API) is a mod that most mods depend on, that is installed separately from Fabric Loader like any other mod.
